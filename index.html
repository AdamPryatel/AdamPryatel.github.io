                    <h2>About</h2>
                    <p>Hello World! I am a 2019 Marketing Major Graduate of Cleveland State University. My Post-Graduation professional experience has taught me the importance of communication and relationship building. In August 2020, I started my LLC to help small businesses with marketing needs. One such organization is in the Software Development Industry. This is the point when I started to learn about coding and began to realize the potential programming has in solving problems! Since then, I made the decision to join We Can Code IT for the Januray 2021 C# Full-Stack Development Cohort.   </p>

                    <p>During my time at We Can Code IT, I worked on a plethora of projects that can help demonstrate and solve professional needs. If you would like to view my latest work, please visit my <a href="https://github.com/AdamPryatel">GitHub account.</a></p>
                    <p>As a professional who strives for growth, my projects are very important. Comparing my first projects to what I can create today, I have noticed substantial growth in my skill set.</p>
                    <p>That is why I chose some of my first basic programs to be featured on my page! There is a common saying in programming. "Be proud of your small victories". I am proud of this early work, while it is not perfect, you are going to want to view the below projects and compare to what I am doing today.</p>
